		<h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
		<h2>August 20, 2012</h2>

		<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: 
		<ol>
			<li>Walla, WA,</li>
			<li>Magic City, ID</li>
			<li>Bountiful, UT,</li>
			<li>Last Chance, CO,</li>
			<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
			<li>Why, AZ</li>
		</ol>

		<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
			<q>"Passing cars,<br /> When you can't see,<br /> May get you,<br /> A glimpse, Of eternity."</q>
			
				I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>
		<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
		<p>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.  
			Because I'm on a Segway,I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
			<ul>
				<li>iPod</li>
				<li>digital camera</li>
				<li>a protein bar</li>
			</ul>
			Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</q>
